# SocioHydrological(SH) model to study Human-Flood Dynamics across US Coast

This repo contains the following files:

*SocioHydroModel_forCalibration.R   This is script of SH model tailored for model calibration

*SocioHydroModel_forProjection.R    This is script of SH model tailored for model projection

*Calibration_HPC.R                  This script simulates SH variables using SocioHydroModel_forCalibration.R and compares with observed SH datasets to calibrate SH parameters using DDS algorithm

*Projection_HPC.R                   This script reads in climate projection datasets and forecasts SH variables using SocioHydroModel_forProjection.R
